\section{Introduction}
The Compose Workbench is a library which enables the consolidation of existing Modules into one cohesive application. The Compose Workbench provides standard elements like a top bar, tab handling, window management and internal information exchange.

\section{Project Requirements}
The Compose Workbench supports two types of Modules, Explorer and Editor. Explorers are used to display data whereas an Editor is used to edit a specific data record. Explorers should be able to request Editors for specific data records and there should be the possibility to have different Editors for the same type of data.

The Compose Workbench has its own messaging system to send and receive messages from all Modules.

The requirements and especially the usability is more detailed in the chapter \emph{Interaction Guide}.

\section{Technical Requirements}
The Compose Workbench has to be written in Kotlin in combination with JetBrains Compose Desktop.

The embedded version of HiveMQ must be used for the messaging system.
